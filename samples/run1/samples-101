======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 story to show off some of the more advanced features in the game

If you don't get the main questline, it won't be hard for you to complete it

The first part of it, after you clear out Tlou

Level 50 is a huge milestone for the franchise

There's a reason why it's called The Phantom Pain

It's not a photoshopped image

It's not even close

Wish the developer had more creative control over the final product

So if you see a bug in the game and can't seem to reproduce it on a normal computer, you should definitely be able to reproduce it on a normal computer

You can click the image to zoom in on it

You can also drop the "frame" part of the link into a page document and have it automatically fill out for you so you don't have to do anything manually

It's a really good idea to have the PDF of the actual game file in which it was originally published so you can compare it to the original game

Have any of you guys seen the leak of the first episode of the saga for sale on eBay?

$200+ worth of game

I read the leaks for tlou 2 last week

What's wrong with just throwing the shells into the regular trash can

Regular trash can

Is there a special arrangement for tlou 2

I don't see the problem

@Nathan Zhao you might want to take a look at the size comparison images on the album cover

Album cover art is nothing like the images people find online

Sure

When it's been implied that we're using it synonymously with define

The images people find online usually have something to do with the people in the pictures

People make bad decisions when they're younger

You shouldn't depend on others to make your decisions for you

You should probably ask them for help on your PAs

Someone give this kid a promotion deal

What's wrong with a simple yes/no question

When it's been implied that we're using it synonymously with define

That's because it doesn't make sense to have a class with multiple sections

You should make the sections voluntary

If you don't see your way forward in terms of having the class continue on even if you don't pass the class then it's probably because you didn't take the section 1 or 2 material

What if

@Miles Labrador are you playing smash?

I didn't make it for launch day so I can't play at all

Miles opened the box of donuts and found a whole new loaf of bread

What is the name of the app I can download that will allow me to add the features I want to the game

What's wrong with having the options to play by myself

If yes...

The left is the same thing

Ooh ok

Anyone know what this is?

I still have the Google drive link in which everyone uploaded their photos

And watch the TA shit on people's self portraits

You should've been in my vis 60 discussion

Howie you should make a zoom account and come into my chases

To Stop Hijackings, Zoom Will Turn on the 'Waiting Room' Feature For All Users And Turn On The 'Wait While They're Away' Feature For All Users

And definitely can't leave him especially now with all that dough coming in

She's his wifey now

He was like 18

I don't think Skype existed back then

Yeah even tho I can't use it

He made zoom cause he was in an ldr and he was tired of taking 10 hour train rides

Eric Yuan is balling

How coronavirus helped this man make $4b in three months

Zoom founder made $4b in st 3 months

Is that about the privacy issues

He played me like a damned fiddle

Played myself

I remember thinking to myself "Nah I'm not falling for that"

Yeah...

I was wondering why it felt like my first time wishing Nathan happy bday

Omg I just remembered last year when I knew that his bday was April 1 but straight up chose not to wish him happy bday for that entire day just in case he was messing with us

709-422-9969

That's because it's just me and Andrew and Tommy in that group rn

@Yunho Jung later I'm going thru a podcast rn

Fuck me

Guys we should have
