It's hilarious to me rn only because the narrator is reading it calm and everything

Yeah that's the story I'm listening to rn

I knew lovecraft was a racist but that's hilarious

Wait really?

I'm reading a lovecraft story rn and the main character's cat is named nwordman

I can use a bot of me to respond to people for me

Make an AI text clone of me

I don't see how making a hashtag part of your profile pic would increase chances of employment

#desperateforwork

This just screams desperation

Thank you master

Food sinner

I wanna know how the convo went after you sent that video link

Lmao

You gotta join the army man

Damn Howie coming in with that esports play breakdown

Ok

Remember prank invasion?

Oh I thought that's been happening like once in a while already on the internet

Where else on the internet is this happening

So smash is having its own #metoo

I see

So this even happened in smash?

Nope

Like harassing them?

Are they looking for chicks or something?

Damn Andrew's already typing up a whole new resume from scratch rn

Microsoft is looking for people to hype up halo infinite on social media before it inevitably becomes a disappointment in the grand scheme of halo

Tell them about how much you grinded for that sweet xp during the school year

Yeah show them pics of it if they don't believe you

Tell them about your mega blocks

Dude you were so close to the forza one so you should definitely be able to bag this one

Forza all oever again I swear

I'm pretty sure I'm approaching the final final chapter of tlou2 and I'm scared to continue cause I don't see any chances of a happy ending

üéâ

So at some point, one of those cams must've seen me taking pics of the place lol

How did you find this?

Actually tho

What should my username be

Does anyone have a spare mojang account I could use

Ok I'll get windows 10 edition

Why

redeemed ex food sinner now food warlord joined the video chat.

this is the psd file if anyone wants to move them around

nintendo just announced a few more dlc characters for smash

I wiretapped his bedroom

I'm setting up the settings of the game and I can already hear the fan

Jeremy... üò¢

Just wanna thank Andrew for getting me this game and returning Doom Eternal

Nope, you are nitpicking and biased, I win, bye bye

I only tolerate my own

I don't tolerate toxicity on this chat üëå

Shut up loser go back to playing pokemon crossing

I'd like to announce that I'll be learning guitar this summer

It could be a glimpse into the future

I just had a dream that Fern backstabbed me in some huge way

Nani

We have enough samples of everyone to make a superhero poster

Ferns face looks like a disappointed parent after he sees your grades

Designathon

Background eraser üëå

Bruh I did those selections with an app on my phone not on photoshop that's why the selections are so rough

Oh ok I thought it'd be terminated

Cause I don't think you still have your ucsd drive

@Howard Chan I can give you my login credentials for my high school drive if you ever need to shit into it

I remember trying to transfer ownership of my files from my high school drive to the ucsd one and finding out I couldn't do I ended up having to re-upload every single folder onto it

Yall should see how much space I take up on my ucsd drive

Damn @Miles Labrador you kinda messed up

My copy of it arrives in a few days

Guys I did it

Did you end up finishing all of it

Duolingo should just play clips of anime shows to teach jap

Bc I watch anime

This showed up in my recommended

Yeah I gotta go to bed

Are yall playing terraria

Yes homo

The meeting is still open I made it 24 hours

Quick reminder that office hours start in 20 minutes

You gotta take a look at this

@Jack Griffin

Join if you wanna play with me and some of my cogs guys

New lobby

It

I have one small project due Friday night and that'll be out

Neon was the nicest looking one

Reminds me of infamous second son and arkham knight

Gosh I love the night scenes

Go be a hero miles

Idk if it is

Wait were you talking about the slow mo part in the beginning

Most of it gotta be cause that's how it was in the first game

Ok now I might have to buy the ps5 now

What's up danger

You guys wanna have a zoom meeting this weekend?

More excited to do that myself when I get the game

Just wanna warn yall that a dog gets molotoved in the video

I know none of you guys actually care but I'm just really excited

Scored above 80 on the final

Passed neurophysiology

Guys I did it

What upgrades do I need to pull that off

How he do dat

Oh no I'm just curious

What was the music video that you used as reference?

^

@Miles Labrador send the video to Brasilia too she'd like it

I had Google use that face as the thumbnail for all images/vids of you

You wanna see it?

Omg you should've asked me to help you look for them! I know the whole album inside out I'm like its librarian

Love the quarantine hair

Omg I just read the description ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

Imma get back to studying

Um

Exactly how I felt when I was editing mine

I love the title of your video so much

I mean just for now until we all get back in person

Why haven't we done a zoom meeting together

Had to pause at 30 secs

Fuck you miles I'm studying for my final rn I can't afford to get all emotional

I better get a good amount of screen time in it

Is that what I think it is

Anne is in my class cause she enrolled in it as an elective and Sahil and I are like why tf would you pick this class for your elective

I'm still going to have to take one more upper div neurobio class after this one üò≠

What I'm learning in this class has nothing to do with what I want to learn

What if

Whether or not I pass this class will determine my mood for the summer cause I hate it so much

Ofc

But I will go over the material tk some extent

I'm planning to take it with a couple other people

But now it's just post midterm 2 material

Dude out prof was going to make it cumulative omg

100 multiple choice

Opens up tomorrow and is due Tuesday

I should

I had a 59 in the class then the prof changed up the grading a bit and now I have 67

I only have one final exam in total and I still haven't started studying for it yet

How grim

How do all yalls finals week look

Damn she didn't even introduce herself to you

What's her name

Jk

No

Do you know what kind of assignments we do

I've already poured my heart and soul into LTWR 8c

It better not have too many writing assignments

Yeah that's what I put down

And let me remind you I've never even taken 5 before

I'd be taking 6 six classes if I go thru with it lol

Did they make you watch Jane the Virgin

No prereq?

Negotiations

What's the class called

I'd die

Dude I'm already thinking about taking 5 classes next quarter

4pm

Ok I'm in

One of my cogs classes already got filled to the brim so I'll be pretty upset if I don't get bigham

Sorry I wasn't paying too much attention

One spot each

I only see b17 and 18

Dang it B10 is full

I'll be in that bitch in 20

The reason why I might actually pass neurophysiology

Adarsh

Does that have anything to do with AS

All of you

You'll find out in the fall

I'd like to assure everyone I've gone far beyond the pizza naan

I just scrolled really fast and saw what Miles said about making a door that doesn't my pizza Naan come thru

I'm seeing so many jokes without any context lol

I think my phone is trickling every single message

Did I miss something

I just woke up from my nap and my phone is having a notification overload

Ok

Idk if I can make it in cause I enroll tomorrow night

I miss raging in Mario kart

No need to mail it

Yeah since it seems like a good number of you guys are

I'll take it thank you

Is the layer flexible?

He made a ps5 on his ps4

He made it in 2 fricking hours too

Pretty damn nice ngl

And some guy recreated the demo in dreams

Shame on you

Spoken like an EA exec

Don't worry it's not too scary

I want you to try out Batman Arkham Asylum

Ugh shut up

Yes thank you for reminding me

Wait nvm that's a stupid question

Have any of you guys seen the ps5 unreal engine demo

YouTube started recommending me footage of Minneapolis to watch

Oakland zoo was broken into and someone took a horse I think

I heard about that

Cause I need to pass one of my classes

Would it also make the wearer smarter too?

Yes

Are you telling me that they're the ones who invent time travel???

How many of you guys have decided you're coming back to LA Jolla for fall?

^

You can use the software I gave you to crack premiere

Loser

If you find them you won't have to start from scratch

Premiere pro has autosaved project files in a folder

What's your video about

Never*

Lmao 6 hours you'll get back

How does that happen

It just went poof?

Like you can't even open it?

So your project file doesn't work anymore?

Yeah fuck Anal

Accelerated reopening

^

June 1st guys

Tailored the course to people with no coding experience

Ellis is a great professor

Cogs 18 is also a good choice

I don't think she'd do the same for you guys now

When I took that class she made attendance worth around 40%

Wait actually nvm I don't think you should take cogs 3 with her especially because your class wouldn't have the same privileges as mine had since it'll be online

Cogs 3

Damn nice shot

Where on you did it land

You gotta come over and hang out at my place so I could show you what I learned

Yeah right after you did

Can someone add me back to the boys and girls chat so I can show off

Started from the pizza Naan now I'm omelette

Wish you guys were here to see me make this

Damn awp taught you well

Crusade sounds better as a car than a board

Who would use bots to add votes to an already losing choice

Sorry Howie

Bruh

Hell yeah Mac n cheese

Sorry I mean Trek

You have a 2% lead over Clinton

Is it wrong for me to watch the votes as closely as people did during election night of 2016

Trek is dangerously close

Hey guys Howie's name for the e board is leading the votes with the runner up only 2.1% away from catching up so vote for his name

The blue one next to the dark magician one

I call sly cooper

You better

üò¢

Ok I'll make sure not to take the same professor as you

Ok

I feel the same but I put down the first section got Bigham for now

Gumm or Big ham

And would anyone like to take it with me

Has anyone not taken cat 125 yet?

Hey Caleb you said you're willing to take math 180a with me right?

Not again

The photo mode blew me away

I just watched the full presentation for ghost of sashimi and now I might get that instead of tlou

@Nathan Zhao @Eric Ke

üéâ

That's the one thing I can contribute to this ap bio convo

Krebs cycle

I've been saving the last episode for later cause I didn't want it to end for me but Nathan just ate up the whole show in one sitting

Can't believe that's a setting

My TA has me work on my technique

Um it's technique assignment

Sorry that's just what my data science hw is called

Guess what I can't even play rocket league rn anyway cause I'm doing my TA rn

That too

This is why I play by myself üôÉ

That's way more accurate

And I didn't even make it for games

All I have is a discord lol

Wish I knew what it's like to play online with friends ‚òπÔ∏è

Why did I let myself wait for that file to load up on my phone as if I was going to download it

This is like those WHAT'S THAT POK√âMON transitions that reveal what it is in the second part of it

Top 10 photos scientists still can't explain

This should be on monsterquest

Rare photo

Food gremlin

Hatred is one of the main themes of the game

Makes a good lure

And when you kill their owner, the dogs will go ove rto them and sob

Yeah they'll be a pain in the ass and that's why I'll have to kill them

Turning a wii into a handheld device

Wth that's so cool

Solid number of them were high school or college kids

There was a lot of crazy stuff in the dataset we found

Like my group did our research project on mass shootings in the US

108 final project is a group research project involving a dataset

Final project for 18 is to make anything you want

Cogs 3 is very separate from 18

Wouldn't make a difference at all

Intro to python

Cogs 18

Would've been awesome if you took cogs 108 and 109 with me for that minor @Tommy Jung

You should invite random people to that chat whose names aren't Tommy

Oh yeah I don't live on campus anymore

It feels like some kind of meta joke to the audience

And there's a line in the trailer that says "I know you wish things were different. I wish things were different. But they ain't"

I like how the new story trailer that dropped today pretends Abby doesn't exist at all

Certainly not happy with what will happen to Joel and Ellie

I read the leaks for tlou 2 last week

Happy Bday Eric üéâüéâ

Wait what was the legendary event

Is that one of those club penguin pet things?

@Fernando Morales @Jack Griffin

People have been protesting about that?

Ok I'm getting the ps5 just for that

Isn't that every game? Every game has its core gameplay style

You should watch me play

You don't often watch me play

I find it fun when I bash people's faces with bricks and watch their intestinal tracts come out when I shotgun them

Like it only works on an old version of Firefox and ie

We have to install this really old and unintuitive software that simulates the behavior of neurons to do our hw

Basic brain structures was lower div stuff

It's neuro anatomy and physiology so it's a lot of cellular level stuff

Did ok on it :(

Made it through the first midterm of neuroanatomy

Ok

Ok

Just need to download an update for the game now

I can't believe my high school Gmail is still useful for something

Give me 10 min

Just gotta make a new email account first

Wait hold on let me get myself another 2 week ps plus trial cause my subscription expired

What time you wanna play

Hell yeah I am

Hoping I'm not the only person with a non passing grade in vis 60 rn

If things go back to normal at the office then maybe I will lol

Last time I played with Eric he took all 3 of my stocks with his Shazam move

File details

Stuff like date and time and location of the photo taken

I agree

A few useful slides I screenshotted from the presentation

The actor for Joel said that players should keep an open mind so that's what I'll do

Yeah if I still decide to get the game then it'd be to enjoy the gameplay improvements

That's disgusting and insulting on so many levels

Oh shit they even compared it to fricking Halo 5

I haven't looked at the leak at all and I'm really scared to

Yeah some developers left and some hope that the game fails

Happened a lot during Uncharted 4 too

The first delay was definitely related to that

Stuff like that forces them to work longer just to check off boxes on their to do lists

They spend so long on literally everything but they don't really have much of structure for project management so a lot of times, people could spend hours doing something just to be told to scrap it by someone else whether it's just not good enough or they've been told there's a change in plan.

Everyone at naughty dog is a perfectionist

Like full plot

Omg it was a massive leak too

$200 is $200

The bottom line is that you still win

If you don't get in trouble and still win then yes it's ok

Or our lovesac

Ikr

Oh shoot ok

Thx but we have our own Costco membership

Im pretty sure I don't need to do anything in person for the cancelation process

My dad's coming tomorrow

I know it needs to be approved

Is that fine?

I submitted my housing cancelation an hour ago and I put tomorrow's date for the move out date

And the shrimp

Yeah ofc

We're using the van

Don't need to

My dad thinks it's a hassle to have me come back to the bay then go back then move out at the end of the year then come back eventually for off campus stuff

Yeah

I didn't pull far enough for one of the sides

Yeah

I just submitted ifixit requests for wherever paint got chipped off

Got it

Ok

When we cancel our housing contract, we just fill out the stuff on the housing portal and return the key right?

Next time I come back, it'd be for off campus apartment stuff

Nope

I want to submit the video to the art contest and win that 40 bucks but idk how I'd cram it into a single post

It's nice of them but I wish they posted the pictures that they wanted to post instead of screenshots of the original post

On Instagram

I love the juicy stuff inside the shrimp head

What's wrong with just throwing the shells into the regular trash can

Ok

How do I do that

I'll check him out

And watching him make things, all of which involve ingredients that I don't have or never heard of in my entire life

I've been watching Gordon Ramsay traveling to foreign countries

Machine learning: a failure on cooking

I promise I won't do it again

Ok I'll use the spatula next time

It's OK I didn't scratch it

What did I do wrong

Omg you're right these guys smell amazing

Ok

I add the seasoning while they're cooking on the pan right?

I can use this

Omg yes

Gonna go to village market later to get eggs

I just want to cook sheimp

I'm out of eggs too üòÅ

I haven't started yet

Should I add soy sauce

I'm hoping the onions add flavor to it lol

I also don't have vegetable oil so I'm going to use butter on the pan instead

I don't have garlic so I'm just gonna throw in onion slices onto the pan instead instead

Gonna wash them now

I was trying to do it the toothpick way but I got pissed cause it wasn't working so I just used a knife

The bottom is a different thing

Ok

Why do we slice the middle top of the shrimp before we cook it

Oof they got me

I don't care about the game but I don't like that a business insider writer is writing about video games

I'll be sure to film myself eating something with this

I'm excited

My taste buds cowered in fear as I was holding this

I'm hurt

I dragged it out and killed it

It's where it used to sleep

Andrew left Isaac's bed stuff here so the room is actually well equipped for a guest

Working*

Laced with onion

Been writing on my scrambled eggs

Dude I haven't bought Naan in a while

You can come to my apartment üòè

If she's planning to come down here soon then I should be like

That's what I wondered

So many attractions are closed

Well thx for the answer @Miles Labrador

Has no right to tell others to hit the books

Burger King never made it past high school math

Lmao

I dare you to report to ai

I should send him the pic of Miles' work as if I did it myself

Gotta be 5

I hope it will

Omg you've already given me so much food to live on

Not the same man

I didn't want to be reminded I was celebrating my bday without you guys so I muted the chat

Thx guys üòò

New sixth makes a great venue

I was partying with the construction guys

God made sure I was born the same day Jesus was resurrected to maintain balance in the world

Be that guy in the class who asks for the zoom link

Do they use zoom at all

Yeah this is cool

Oh you don't know?

What language are you learning

Definitely not Berkeley

That's true

Sorry I saw her as hostile

A TA just responded to the thread with the same link I sent

I'm just trying to clarify what I did

So here is the post that asked basically the same question as me

When it's been implied that we're using it synonymously with determined

She was using the word measured like it's only for numerical data

Ok I'm going to take a nap, I might not be in the right state of mind rn

Ik but she answered in a condescending way

I just didn't want to let her get away with making me sound like I don't know anything about statistics

It's definitely not personal

So I posted an answer to that question saying yes nominal data would have to count as a variable and added the link to the post that asked the same question and had the TA saying that nominal data would count as a variable

It's word for word

No they literally did

She wasn't right

I scrolled down on the questions cause I was looking for a post about something else and came across a post that basically asked the same question

"No you can't measure a name - 'nominal' is something that is named"

That same bitch fucking answered the exact same way she responded to me on the zoom chat

Idk who posted it but

A little while later, I see my exact question copied and pasted into a piazza post

First of all you cunt, I know that

So then

"Nom" - "name" you can't measure a name

If nominal data counts as a variable being measured in our assignment. I knew what the answer was but I was hoping for my prof to basically confirm what I was thinking. The prof didn't see my question in the chat so she didn't answer. Some bitch named Elizabeth Hostetter answered :

Just a while ago, I asked in the chat during a zoom lecture

Ok so

For what she tried to do to me

I want her to burn

Guys I just destroyed someone on piazza

I can return it

0-0 bb

I'm gonna drop out of the team now üò¢

It's not what happened

Idk how I'm gonna play now without my tv

I'll get it tomorrow

The screen just goes white now when I turn it on

Sure

I'm mourning rn

I'm not answering any questions

Wish the TCL stayed with me

It's literally the second week of the quarter

You can play rocket league with me while you wait @Cameron Joh

And I was like that's a fat one

I legit thought I was a potato lol

Yes!

The left is the same thing

Ooh ok

Anyone know what this is?

I still have the Google drive link in which everyone uploaded their photos

And watch the TA shit on people's self portraits

You should've been in my vis 60 discussion

Howie you should make a zoom account and come into my chases

To Stop Hijackings, Zoom Will Turn on the 'Waiting Room' Feature For All Users

And definitely can't leave him especially now with all that dough coming in

She's his wifey now

He was like 18

I don't think Skype existed back then

Yeah even tho I can't use it

He made zoom cause he was in an ldr and he was tired of taking 10 hour train rides

Eric Yuan is balling

How coronavirus helped this man make $4b in three months

Zoom founder made $4b in st 3 months

Is that about the privacy issues

He played me like a damned fiddle

Played myself

I remember thinking to myself "Nah I'm not falling for that"

Yeah...

I was wondering why it felt like my first time wishing Nathan happy bday

Omg I just remembered last year when I knew that his bday was April 1st but straight up chose not to wish him happy bday for the entire day just in case he was messing with us

709-422-9969

That's because it's just me and Andrew and Tommy in that group rn

@Yunho Jung later I'm going thru a podcast rn

Fuck me

Guys we should have a zoom meeting

Yeah

Down

Fuck me

Eric waiting for someone to fuck him

He looks like he's afraid how big it is

Flextape

@Caleb Schimke

Is move in day for us on 9/15 just like the first years or is it a different day

Is this the kind of person you see Nathan as

And says it'd be worse in Jack's room despite being the guy who snores every night

Nathan in your dream wakes up right when you're leaving to sleep in another room just to keep you from leaving

Wow Nathan in your dream sounds like an asshole lol
